      <p class="who-para">  Adolescence is a time of self-discovery and identity formation, when young people begin to establish a sense of who they are, what they believe in, and where they fit in the world. This makes adolescence a sensitive developmental window, characterized by significant opportunities. The better we help this young ones find natural talents, the more they can draw from them to search for  and identify opportunities that will give them the chance to do what they do best every day, so they can then turn their raw talents into matured strengths and live up to their full potential....thus the creation of the TEEN SINGING COMPETITION "THE NEXT TEEN STAR".</p>

  Improvising with music can help a child to get in touch with and/or express a feeling he or she may be experiencing at the time. whether that may be happy, sad, scared, or mad. The musical instruments can be 'gates' for their emotions and playing them or singing to them allows their emotions to come through
We hope that this becomes a successful yearly event that teenagers and their families would look  foward to.
